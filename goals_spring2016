Status Update: 
to do:
-ensure that varibale feature on the right of H-alpha is in section 2
-create a table with the following columns: file name, index number, signal:noise, shift, orbital phase, rms (all 3) 
-scale up to 100 data files
-for S:N take section of spectrum away from H-alpha line, mulitply by 2 (CCD gain), take median of range(~500pixels) and take square 
root
*JD: use the ones from e-mail (11/13) unless they are the same as those in fits files, with conversion constant given
-phase=(JD-Tt)/P, JD from email, Tt=midpoint, you will need to subtract constant (use mod function to calculate)<<test with JD=200,205,210,220

plots: use rms sections 1 and 3, should be the same for all spectra
-signal to noise versus JD and phase
-shift versus JD and phase
-rms 1 and 3 versus JD and phase
^ 6 plots total
-plot shift versus rms
-spectral feature and difference spectra for all 100 spectra (test with different templates different in time)

*-histogram of phases
*-histogram of signal to noise ratio
*save them all in screen captures, identify shifting/scaling edits needed 

4/5:
-plot each spectrum one-by-one next to calculated pixel shift to make sure the shift works
-fix normalization on strange ones
-get rid of rollover on the sides of each spectrum (want the section 1 and 3 RMS plots to be even)
-change phase bin size to have more phases, should see flatter distribution
