Status Update: 
to do:
-ensure that varibale feature on the right of H-alpha is in section 2 (done)
-create a table with the following columns: file name, index number, signal:noise, shift, orbital phase, rms (all 3) (done)
-scale up to 100 data files (done)
-for S:N take section of spectrum away from H-alpha line, mulitply by 2 (CCD gain), take median of range(~500pixels) and take square 
root
*JD: use the ones from e-mail (11/13) unless they are the same as those in fits files, with conversion constant given
-phase=(JD-Tt)/P, JD from email, Tt=midpoint, you will need to subtract constant (use mod function to calculate)<<test with JD=200,205,210,220

plots: use rms sections 1 and 3, should be the same for all spectra (done)
-signal to noise versus JD and phase
-shift versus JD and phase
-rms 1 and 3 versus JD and phase
^ 6 plots total
-plot shift versus rms (done)
-spectral feature and difference spectra for all 100 spectra (test with different templates different in time) (done)

*-histogram of phases (done)
*-histogram of signal to noise ratio (done)
*save them all in screen captures, identify shifting/scaling edits needed (done)

4/5:
-plot each spectrum one-by-one next to calculated pixel shift to make sure the shift works
-fix normalization on strange ones
-get rid of rollover on the sides of each spectrum (want the section 1 and 3 RMS plots to be even) and plot 
lines where you cut them off
-change phase bin size to have more phases, should see flatter distribution

4/12:
(1)phase histogram peak at 0.5
timestamp=2.44e6 days + JD from column of text file; should be consistent
-add to histogram vertical dotted line at ingress and egress, MP should be connsistent with file dates
-label x axis, number on y axis on everything

(2) shift plot: make the right shifts negative
-make sure labels are on y axis

(3) iodine spectra: plot them, see if we can observe by eye any similar features around h alpha wavelengths
-check template observation to see if it has iodine- open header of fits file, look at iodine column (i2), should 
indicate no in template file
-overplot iodine in and iodine out (both out of transit), check for features that we see in spectra plot

(4) lamp file: plot same order/section to check for iodine features

(5) print in rms plot blue and red median rms value ***before you make any edits***

(6) rms improvements : 1. increase wavelength range for entire spectrum, 2. normalize according to line connecting section 1 and 3 media
(overplot line) 3. higher interpolated shift
update: 1. theoretically should not help with rms calculations because rollover must be cut off in same place regardless of 
  original array size
  3. will run interpolated shift over night

(7) all iodine spectra 


4/19:
-check shifts by printing shift on screen and changing template to one with phase=0.5 (shifts should be grouped near 0)
-check for iodine features: (1) fit 5th order blaze function to quartz lamp spectrum, divide and look for iodine features by eye
(2) plot offset iodine and no iodine star spectra from star data set 

(3)^^ after blaze function is fized with entire order, also divide by a line connecting two points of clipped spectra

(4) investigate possible absorption features from Earth's atmosphere
